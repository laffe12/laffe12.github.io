Hey there! I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in physics and mathematics, though computers and tech have always been my true passion. I’m all about breaking down complex problems using first principles thinking, which has been a big asset both in physics and in cybersecurity.

 I love taking part in CTF competitions regularly, and I use this blog to share write-ups on the latest challenges. It’s a great way to showcase my approach to real-world security issues and to keep refining my skills.

 Beyond cybersecurity, physics and tech, I'm deeply interested in chess, physical/mental health and philosophy. Chess keeps my strategic thinking sharp, while philosophy pushes me to explore the “why” behind everything I do.
