# Langtidsminne

A user has fallen victim to a phishing attack, unknowingly downloading and executing an unverified program. According to the challenge description the program was executed around 14:12. We are given a memory dump from the event and our task is to identify the malicious program that was executed.

To analyze the memory dump we can use the program *Volatility*. After trying a few different plugins/commands from a Volatility cheat sheet (https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/basic-forensic-methodology/memory-dump-analysis/volatility-cheatsheet) we found one that shows what programs was run by the user, so called UserAssist keys.

<code>python3 vol.py -f memdump.elf windows.registry.userassist.UserAssist > userassist</code>

We preform the UserAssist analysis and save the output to a file. Looking through the file we find that around 14:12 a suspicious program called *metasploit_psexec_session_stager.exe* was exectued.

Wrap the program name inside the cratectf tag and we got the flag: cratectf{metasploit_psexec_session_stager.exe}

# Golf-SM

In this challenge we play golf over netcat. After some elaboration and testing we realize that we want to input -900 to score a hole in one on the last hole. However, negative numbers are not allowed. We can bypass this by using an integer overflow technique. A 32 bit integer can hold numbers up to 2<sup>32</sup> - 1 (4294967295). In the program the number 4294967296 is interpreted as 0. So if we input 2<sup>32</sup> - 900 = 4294966396 we score a hole in one and get the flag.

# Red teaming?

The challenge description tells us something about a guy watching TV and we are given a file with binary data.

We inspect the data with *xxd*

<code>xxd data.bin</code>

![Red-teaming](../assets/img/crate-ctf2024/red_teaming.jpg)

Googling the hex values e0e040bf we came across a website with remote control binary codes ([https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Codes-for-IR-Remotes/](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Codes-for-IR-Remotes/ "https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Codes-for-IR-Remotes/")). These match our data perfectly. 

By using the table from the website and python we were able to translate the instructions in our binary data and get a list that looks like this.

<code>xE0E040BF - TOGGLE ON/OFF <br>
0xE0E08877 - 0<br>
0xE0E0708F - 9<br>
0xE0E0708F - 9<br>
0xE0E0F00F - MUTE<br>
0xE0E020DF - 1<br>
0xE0E020DF - 1<br>
0xE0E010EF - 4<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
0xE0E020DF - 1<br>
0xE0E0A05F - 2<br>
0xE0E0906F - 5<br>
0xE0E0F00F - MUTE<br>
0xE0E040BF - TOGGLE ON/OFF<br></code>
The numbers in between the strings TOGGLE ON/OFF and MUTE seems to be ASCII numbers.

Using python we can extract these numbers and translate them into readable text and we get the flag.
